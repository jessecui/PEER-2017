                     <p> PEER has played a very important role in my freshman year. It helped me find my place on campus and how I fit in not only as a first generation low income student, but also as a Asian woman and developing leader. Through my interactions with my mentor I was able to grow as a leader and also develop a meaningful relationship with someone outside of my family. PEER allowed me to be braver and I know the skills I learned through the program and through my mentor will guide me through my next three years at Penn.</p>

                     <p> Joining PEER as a mentor in my senior year has to rank amongst the most fulfilling and valuable experiences in my four years at Penn. There's no program at Penn that helps mentors and mentees alike grow personally quite like PEER. For mentees, the PEER community is so supportive - everyone has your back. For mentors, it is a great way to give back, especially as many of us have benefited from mentorship. But the best thing about PEER is that it is a family, much more than just a mentor-mentee relationship. I was fortunate to develop close relationships with many mentees and mentors, friendships that I will treasure forever. PEER is a wonderful program, and I highly recommend applying - you won't regret it.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                     <p> PEER has always been my family at Penn. In high school, I never felt like I had a close community of friends. As an incoming freshman to Penn, I didn't know anybody, and I wasn't close with my hall--I was worried that I wouldn't find a community. But after the fall PEER retreat, I had suddenly made almost 40 friends. With these friends, I spent nights talking about the meaning of life until sunrise, learned how to ice skate and even have a snowball fight on the ice, threw midnight surprise birthday parties, raided empty classrooms in Williams Hall to study (and a lot of not studying while playing Tetris and watching movies), singing karaoke to way too many Taylor Swift songs, learning insider knowledge about campus life that only an upperclassman can tell you, and much much much more. But even beyond fun activities and doing things, I know the friends I've met through PEER are my closest friends because they're the ones who I can just relax and do nothing with when I feel lonely and want to be around other people. Because Penn is a decently large school, it's difficult to stay in contact with all the friends you make, yet I've effortlessly managed to stay as close as ever with the friends I met in PEER, even after the program ended. </p>

                    <p> I've gotten involved in other things at Penn after PEER--I've run for board positions, learned to swing dance, acted in cultural shows, and joined a fraternity--but I was inspired to do all of those because of meeting people in PEER who had done them first. </p>

                    <p>Basically, joining PEER my freshman year has been at the root of nearly every experience I've had at Penn. I can't express clearly enough how grateful I am for everything that PEER has given me.</p>

                     <p> How do I even begin. Now that I'm actually going into my last year of college, it's really starting to hit me how precious each moment is while I'm still here. And most of the happiest moments that pop into my mind come from the silly, emotional, and truly intimate memories I have of PEER. I was a completely lost and awkward freshman. I came in knowing absolutely no one, and was shocked that seasons other than summer existed. But the most surprising and sweet realization I have after being in PEER, is how we could change so quickly from being complete strangers into being 2 am late-night talking buddies. This family helped me forget my fears and I just let myself be happily free. I'm definitely still the awkward person that I was, but being a part of this close-knit group has shown me how it's the simple things that show how valuable people really are.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                     <p> I was lucky enough to be a part of PEER for all 4 of my years at Penn, as a mentee, a board member, and a mentor. It probably sounds exaggerated but this mentoring program is probably one of the main reasons I loved being at Penn. To be honest, I didn't enjoy my freshman year as much as I had expected to and one of the sole reasons I made it through freshman year was because of my mentor. He became one of my closest confidants. We met every week for a meal to update each other on all aspects of our lives: academic, extra curricular, social, and relationships. As a mentee, you're paired with just one upperclassman, but PEER is more than just the one-on-one mentorship. I grew close to some of the other upperclassmen and the mentees as well. That's what sets this mentoring program apart from a lot of the others -- the community. You automatically have a diverse group of people you can rely on for a lot of things, like advice on majors and professors, a group to attend shows on campus with, and people to go on adventures with off campus. Another aspect of PEER that makes it unique is that it is an Asian American mentoring program. Exploring Asian Pacific Islander issues that hadn't even crossed my mind before -- mental health, undocumented immigrants, media representation -- with my peers on that first retreat proved to be a pivotal moment in my life. It really shaped my time at Penn. But PEER never forces to be involved with just the Asian community on campus. Since the mentors and board members are involved in a variety of activities on campus, you get to learn about so many different opportunities. All the upperclassmen are so willing to pass on things they wish they knew as freshmen.</p>

                    <p> I continued to be involved with PEER after my freshman year because I really believed in the program and wanted to make it even better. I can honestly say that after four years, PEER is now at its best. I met some of my best friends because of this program. As cliche as it sounds, college is all about finding yourself and your passions and making lasting relationships with the people you're living with for four years. PEER definitely helps in all aspects.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                     <p> Entering Penn as an incoming first-gen, low-income Chinese-Vietnamese student two years ago, I scrambled to find my place on campus, a place where I could actually "fit in," for a lack of better words. I sought high and low for a community that not only accepted me, but also one that provided the space for me to grow as a student, individual, and (aspiring) leader. When I initially joined PEER as a mentee in the fall of 2014, I began to push the boundaries of my comfort zone. I started to engage with APIA students who shared an interest in exploring their Asian American identities and sharing their personal narratives, which was an opportunity I rarely came across prior to my time at Penn. Ranging from diverse and unique backgrounds, these students quickly became the friends I can confidently say will last me a lifetime. From competing in online Tetris matches at Williams Hall to cramming for Multivariable Calculus before an exam, I have truly been blessed with the opportunity to meet great and like-minded individuals who share a passion for not only engaging with the broader APIA community, but also people who take the time and effort to foster deep and everlasting friendships.</p>

                    <p> During my second year at Penn, I served as the Chair for the PEER Mentoring Program. Among many other things, I learned that mentorship stretches far beyond the boundaries of a mentor and mentee relationship. It truly calls on patience, compassion, love, open-mindedness, appreciation, and more. I believe mentorship, especially ones provided through PEER, fosters tremendous growth in areas essential to individuality. Personally speaking, I never would have imagined myself to gain the quality skills and experience to lead a student organization like PEER. However, my advisors, board members, and past PEER participants have altogether provided me the stepping stones in which I discovered not only my leadership potential, but also confidence in being an FGLI student. I am amazed to have had the opportunity to serve such a well-rounded and inspiring group of young men and women. I am excited to return as a mentor and I look forward to contributing to PEER many more ways!</p>

                     <p> I had been really skeptical to join any student organizations, especially APA ones, before I joined PEER. PEER has allowed me to meet and get to know many students from my same class, as well as other upperclassmen who are interested in building a strong APA community at Penn. Through PEER, I have been exposed to other APA student organizations and programs such as VSA and APALI, which helped me stay further involved with the APA community.</p>

                    <p> One of the best things that happened to me at PEER was the service project. It allowed me to, along with my teammates, actually do something to raise awareness of certain issues that the greater APA community at Penn has faced. Through PEER, moreover, I have gained access to many valuable resources that I would not have otherwise known. </p>

                    <p> I strongly recommend incoming freshmen to apply to PEER because the strong mentor-mentee system will serve as the most valuable resource for them to get accustomed to the new environment at Penn. I have learned tremendously from my mentor, as well as from other upperclassmen throughout the whole year I was in PEER.</p>
